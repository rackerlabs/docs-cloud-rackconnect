Contract version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Rackspace RackConnect version defines the contract and build
information for the API.

The contract version denotes the data model and behavior that the API
supports. The requested contract version is included in all request
URLs. Different contract versions of the API might be available at any
given time and are not guaranteed to be compatible with one another. In this example, the 
contract version is ``v3``.
